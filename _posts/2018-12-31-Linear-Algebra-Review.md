## 1. Matrices and Vectors
Matrices are 2-dimensional arrays. The matrix below has four rows and three columns, so it is a 4 x 3 matrix. 

$$
M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
 4 &  9 &  8 \\
-1 &  2 & -6 \\
 2 &  5 &  2 \\
 2 & -7 &  3 \\
\end{array} \right)
$$

A vector is a matrix with one column and many rows. The vector below is a 4 x 1 matrix.

$$
M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
 4 \\
-1 \\
 2 \\
 2 \\
\end{array} \right)
$$

## 2. Addition and Scalar Multiplication

Addition and subtraction are element-wise, so you simply add or subtract each corresponding element:

$$
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
a & b \\
c & d \\
\end{array} \right)
+
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
w & x \\
y & z \\
\end{array} \right)
=
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
a+w & b+x \\
c+y & d+z \\
\end{array} \right)
$$
