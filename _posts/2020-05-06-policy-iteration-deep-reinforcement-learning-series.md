## Article Goal

In this article, our goal will be to implement one of the powerful algorithm called **Policy Iteration algorithm** to compute the value functions, $$v^*$$ or $$q^*$$. We can easily obtain optimal policies once we have found the optimal value functions. Policy Iteration algorithm use a dynamic programming (DP) approach where we have complete knowledge of the environment or all the MDP variables. 

In DP, instead of solving complex problems one at a time, we break the problem into simple sub-problems, then for each sub-problem, we compute and store the solution. If the same sub-problem occurs, we will not recompute, instead, we use the already computed solution.
