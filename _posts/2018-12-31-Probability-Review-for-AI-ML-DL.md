## 1. The Axioms of Probability

Consider an experiment whose sample space is .  For each event E of the sample space we assume that a number E is defined and satisfies the following three axioms:  

**Axiom 1** states probability that the outcome of the experiment is an outcome in E is some number between 0 and 1.  
$$
0 \le P(E) \le 1
$$

**Axiom 2** states that with probability 1, the outcome will be a point in the sample space S.  

$$
P(S) = 1
$$

## 2. Naive Definition of Probability
This is where I talk about Conditional probability.

## 3. Chain Rule
This is where I talk about chain Rule.

## 4. Bayes Rule
This is where I talk about Bayes Rule.

## 5. Discrete Random Variables
This is where I talk about Random Variables.

## 6. Continuous Random Variables
This is where I talk about Random Variables.
