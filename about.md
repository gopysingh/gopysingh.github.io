Welcome to my Github portfolio. I share some of my work and knowledge on this blog.

## Projects

**Deep Learning Project - Kaggle Airbus Ship Detection Challenge**

Ship detection has a wide range of real life application, in the areas of maritime traffic, monitoring of marine pollution, border control, etc. The kaggle challenge is to detect ships in satellite images and generate mask images of ships. The final model chosen is a transfer learning model for image classification to classify if an image contains a ship or not and Mask R-CNN, a deep convolutional neural network architecture, for detection and segmentation of ships. I implemented the convolutional neural network using the Mask-RCNN provided by Keras and run the code on a Google Cloud Platform with four Intel i7 CPUs, 32 GB memory and 1 NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU.
